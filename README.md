Man, that was wild. I just stumbled out of A Minecraft Movie like I walked off an alien spaceship, colors still flashing in the back of my head like some cosmic aftertaste. It's like I was dunked in a sea of pixelated blocks, trying to swim but sinking in a kaleidoscope of squares. You know the feeling when you spill popcorn in your lap and for a moment it’s an existential crisis? Like why are they even made of corn, and who decided?

So this   – it’s like they took the word “epic” and laminated it with pixel art. There's Steve, swinging a diamond sword like a demonic, pixellated Metronome, slashing through creepers and my sense of reality. At one point in the theater, I swear the surround sound had my bones vibrating like those fish bones left over after you eat. You feel me? The Ender Dragon swooped down and I jumped so hard that my spine protested. It’s loud and ridiculous, and the guy behind me kept narrating it to his friend as if Steve were slowly mining his soul, block by block.

> Halfway through, I was thinking, “Man, I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to see if my brain would break again at home.” But the screen, the noise, the MOVEMENT, you have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in the dark, popcorn stuck in your shoe, to know. There was this scene with a TNT explosion that made my seat shake like when the subway roared beneath us in NYC, where you think it's just a train but what if it’s moles planning a revolt? Crazy.

This flick is like if you took reality and played god with its sliders, ramped up saturation and distilled all logic to lego logic... Right? Somehow I craved to ride that blocky pig in the infinite landscapes, even as my eyes screamed for mercy. It felt like a digital fever dream, in a good way? Maybe? Characters spoke and trees loomed like ancient 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩towers of a long-forgotten low-res world.

Not sure, was it genius or madness in cubiform? It had all these colors, like a box of crayons exploded, but more digital. Am I making sense? Probably not. Even my thoughts are opening new tabs, like oops.

Here’s that code snippet, whatever, just ignore:

```
def pixelize():
    while True:
    return sq_pixel  undefined
    #what am i doing???
```
